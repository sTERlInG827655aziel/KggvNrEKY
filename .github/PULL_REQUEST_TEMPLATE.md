Please check our [style guide](https://docs.pymc.io/en/latest/contributing/jupyter_style.html), and also make sure that the notebooks you've modified pass the `pre-commit` checks. If, for example, you modified `notebook1.ipynb` and `notebook2.ipynb`, you could do this by running:

```bash
pre-commit run --files notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb
```

You may need to run it a couple of times before all the checks pass.
